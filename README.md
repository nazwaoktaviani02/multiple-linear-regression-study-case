Case Context:
A school wants to understand how students’ study habits affect their final exam performance. Using data from previous students—including hours studied, attendance rate, and number of practice tests taken—the goal is to build a predictive model that estimates final exam scores. This helps educators identify which factors most influence academic success and how to better support students.

Objective: 
To predict students' final exam scores based on three factors:
- Hours Studied
- Attendance Rate (%)
- Number of Practice Tests Taken

Method:
A Multiple Linear Regression model is used to estimate the relationship between these variables and the final score using a small historical dataset.
